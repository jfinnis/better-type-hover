NOTE: forked to customize hover fallback to another plugin

*If you find this plugin useful, consider giving it a ‚≠ê so I know how many are using it. The more people, the more love it gets (maintenance & features)!*

# The problem

The ts_ls (typescript lsp) `vim.lsp.buf.hover()` is in many cases completely useless:

## The solution

This plugin improves `vim.lsp.buf.hover()` by actually showing the exact declaration of the `interface` or `type` (crazy how that's not the default ü§î). 

Additionally, you can press the sign on the line to open yet another window with the declaration of the "nested type":

# Installation

Lazy.nvim
```lua
{
  "Sebastian-Nielsen/better-type-hover",
  ft = { "typescript", "typescriptreact" }, 
  config = function()
    require("better-type-hover").setup()
  end,
}
```

# Config

These are all the default options for reference:

```lua
require("better-type-hover").setup({
	-- The primary key to hit to open the main window
	openTypeDocKeymap = "<C-P>",
        -- Whether to fallback to the old `vim.lsp.buf.hover()` when triggered on anything but an interface or type.
        -- Strongly adviced to keep this on true as it's not stable otherwise.
	fallback_to_old_on_anything_but_interface_and_type = true,
	-- If the declaration in the window is longer than 20 lines remove all lines after the 20th line. 
	fold_lines_after_line = 20,
	-- These letters/digits are used in order
	keys_that_open_nested_types = { 'a', 's', 'b', 'i', 'e', 'u', 'r', 'x' },
	-- This is to avoid a type hint (i.e. a letter) showing up in the main window
	types_to_not_expand = {"string", "number", "boolean", "Date"}
})

-- After calling the setup you can overwrite any of the colors with: 
vim.cmd('highlight key_hint_color guifg=#FFFFFF guibg=NONE') -- white
vim.cmd('highlight selected_key_hint_color guifg=#BC0000 guibg=NONE') -- red 

-- If you want to customize the fallback window use:
 vim.lsp.handlers["textDocument/hover"] = vim.lsp.with(
  vim.lsp.handlers.hover,
  {}  -- e.g. { border = "rounded" }
)
```

# Known issues

- [ ] Opening the popup too close to the edge of the screen: https://gyazo.com/df079cebabee1526318c12bf71c5242c
- [ ] Handle that a nested type is e.g. `style?: StyleHTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement> & CSSProperties;`. Currently, it only expands the left-most (`StyleHTMLAttributes<HTMLDivElement>` in this case). This one is hard to solve because you could in theory have something like `style?: A & (B | (C & D)) | E & F & ...` and which one is it expected to open here? And how would you prompt the user to choose one? 
[Maybe use `Prettify`](https://www.reddit.com/r/typescript/comments/1jf9zs1/how_to_get_useful_intellisense_for_complex_types/)?
- [ ] When opening a requested type, it's currently hardcoded to always request the doc-definition at column one of the type, this is incorrect in case of e.g. `JSX.Element` as that would fetch the doc of `JSX` where it instead actually should had returned the doc for `Element`. So insert logic that checks if the type contains a dot and if it does then trigger the doc-definition on the first column to the right of the last dot. https://gyazo.com/be0374a6b75e3086c2dee4d095f24666
- [ ] If you put a key that expects a motion immediately afterwards (e.g. `d`, `c`, `g`, `f`, `t`) into `keys_that_open_nested_types`, then you are going to experience a delay when triggering it: https://gyazo.com/a28e06b2689a99264882ff7b67297009. 

# Todo:

- [ ] Feature idea: Be able to indefintely expand nested_types. Show letter-hints in the second window so that you can expand nested_types in the second window. When a nested_type in the second window is requested to be expanded, the content of the second window will be replaced by the requested declaration.
